# Infinite-Dimensional Wave Theory: mass predictions from a single unit reference.
#
# The single empirical framework: a Dirac spinor field Psi_inf lives on an
# infinite-dimensional manifold M_inf = R^{3,1} x (sector manifolds). Particles
# are standing-wave resonances in the sector space. Their masses are:
#
#     m(n, d) = m_scale(d) x S(n, d)
#
# where S(n,d) = C(n+d-1, d) = dim(Sym^{n-1}(C^{d+1})) is the cumulative count
# of monomials of degree 0 through n-1 in d variables; and m_scale(d) is derived
# from seeds and coupling constants.
# m_e is the sole unit reference — it converts dimensionless mass ratios into MeV.
# No free parameters whatsoever. All masses, including the W boson, follow from m_e and seeds.

def S(n, d):
    """
    S(n, d) = C(n+d-1, d)  -- the binomial coefficient used throughout IDWT.

    Mathematical identity: S(n,d) = dim(Sym^{n-1}(C^{d+1})), the dimension of
    the (n-1)-th symmetric power of C^{d+1}. Equivalently, S(n,d) is the
    cumulative count of monomials of degree 0 through n-1 in d variables:

        S(n,d) = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} C(k+d-1, d-1)     [hockey-stick identity]

    This is NOT the count of degree-n monomials in d variables (that is
    C(n+d-1, d-1), one index off). The distinction matters: S(1,d) = 1 for
    all d (ground state uniqueness), while C(d-1, d-1) = 1 only trivially.

    Physical meaning in IDWT: S(n,d) counts the cumulative sector microstates
    at excitation levels 0 through n-1 in sector d. The mass formula
    m(n,d) = m_scale_d * S(n,d) assigns mass proportional to this count.
    (Part 1 section 5, Part 2 section 1)

    Spectral grounding (d=3): S(n,3) = (1/2) * N_{D_{S^3}}(n-1), where
    N_{D_{S^3}}(n-1) is the cumulative positive Dirac eigenvalue count on the
    unit 3-sphere at levels 0 through n-1. (Theorem S1, Part 8 section 60b)

    The hockey-stick recursion S(n,d) = S(n,d-1) + S(n-1,d) is the algebraic
    engine behind the eigenmode selection rule: every filtration relationship is a
    consequence of Pascal's triangle applied at specific fixed points.

# =============================================================================
# STEP 1 -- BUILD THE MODE-INDEX TOWER
# =============================================================================
# The entire particle spectrum follows from two forced integers:
#   n_s = 4  (the single non-trivial seed, forced by the muon fixed-point)
#   n_d = 1  (trivially forced: S(1,d)=1 for every sector d)
# Every other mode index, including n_up, is derived by explicit addition
# using the hockey-stick recursion. No other inputs.
# (Part 2 sections 2-4, Part 1 section 5)

# --- Seeds -------------------------------------------------------------------
# n_d = 1  (down quark: the universal ground state)
# S(1, d) = C(d, d) = 1 for every d, so the ground-state mode index is
# identically 1 in every sector. No other value is consistent. (Part 2 section 2)
n_down = 1

# n_s = 4  (strange quark: the unique non-trivial seed)
# The unique positive integer satisfying S(n_s, 4) = n_mu = 35, where n_mu is
# the muon mode index. This self-referential fixed point -- the muon mode is the
# d=4 image of the strange mode -- has exactly one solution: n_s = 4.
# (Part 2 section 2, Part 1 section 5)
n_strange = 4  # unique solution to S(n_strange, 4) = 35

# --- First derived index: up quark -------------------------------------------
# n_up = n_s - 1 = 3
# Derived from n_s via the Hopf chain reduction: the d=4 sector ground state
# sits one level below n_s. Equivalently, n_up = n_s - 1 is required for the
# geometric back-reaction factor n_s/n_up = 4/3 to be the ratio of consecutive integers
# (forced by the d=10 self-consistency, Part 2 section 9). This is not a seed.
n_up = n_strange - 1   # = 3  (derived)

# --- Neutrino mode indices ---------------------------------------------------
# Neutrinos live in the d=5 sector (S^5). Their mode indices are derived as
# simplex images of the up quark seed into lower sectors. The d=5 sector
# admits only Dirac spinors (d mod 8 = 5 forbids Majorana by Clifford algebra mod 8 periodicity),
# which is why neutrinos are predicted to be Dirac fermions with no Majorana
# mass and no seesaw mechanism. (Part 1 section 6, Part 2 section 6, Part 8 section 59.1)

# n_nu1 = S(n_up, 3) = S(3, 3) = C(5,3) = 10
# The first neutrino mode index is the image of the up quark seed under the
# d=3 simplex map. The d=5 sector couples to d=3 via the Vandermonde rule,
# and the lightest d=5 mode resonates at the d=3 simplex value of the up quark.
n_nu1 = S(n_up, 3)    # = 10

# n_nu2 = S(n_up, 4) = S(3, 4) = C(6,4) = 15
# Second neutrino mode: the image of the up quark seed into d=4. This equals
# C(6,2) = 15 by binomial symmetry C(n,k) = C(n,n-k), which connects it
# directly to n_W = 76 via: n_W = S(n_e, 2) - n_nu2 = 91 - 15 = 76.
# The binomial symmetry C(n,k)=C(n,n-k) applied here is what makes the
# coupling coefficient universal across the two Hopf pairs. (Part 2 section 5,
# Part 3 section 11)
n_nu2 = S(n_up, 4)    # = 15

# n_nu3 = n_nu1 + n_nu2 - n_up = 10 + 15 - 3 = 22
# The third neutrino mode is selected by the comb filtration condition at d=5.
# Cross-check: n_nu3 = n_tau - n_down = 23 - 1 = 22. (Part 2 section 6)
n_nu3 = n_nu1 + n_nu2 - n_up   # = 22

# --- Lepton mode indices (via the comb filtration rule) ----------------------
# Eigenmode selection rule: n_lepton = n_neutrino + n_quark_partner.
# This is the hockey-stick identity S(n,d) = S(n,d-1) + S(n-1,d) applied
# at specific combinatorial fixed points. It is a theorem.
# (Part 2 section 4)

# n_e = n_nu1 + n_up = 10 + 3 = 13
# Electron: the lightest lepton. This is the unique d=6 mode consistent
# with the comb filtration at stage 1. (Part 2 section 4)
n_e = n_nu1 + n_up    # = 13

# n_charm = S(n_s, 3) = S(4, 3) = C(6,3) = 20
# Charm quark: the d=4 image of the strange seed via the d=3 simplex map.
# This is the unique d=4 mode selected by the sector comb at filtration stage 2.
n_charm = S(n_strange, 3)   # = 20

# n_mu = n_charm + n_nu2 = 20 + 15 = 35 = S(4,4)
# Muon: second-generation lepton. This is BOTH n_charm + n_nu2 (eigenmode selection rule)
# AND S(4,4) = C(7,4) = 35 (the d=4 self-image of the strange seed). These
# coinciding is a theorem from the hockey-stick identity -- it is what forced
# n_strange = 4 in the first place. (Part 2 sections 2 and 4)
n_mu = n_charm + n_nu2   # = 35; cross-check: S(n_strange, 4) = 35 exactly

# n_tau = n_nu3 + n_down = 22 + 1 = 23
# Tau: third-generation charged lepton, d=10 sector (CP⁵, d mod 8 = 2 Majorana-Weyl).
# d=10 contains only the tau lepton; top/bottom/nu_tau are in d=4/3/5 respectively.
# (Part 1 §3d, Part 2 §7)
n_tau = n_nu3 + n_down    # = 23

# --- Up-type quark mode indices ----------------------------------------------

# n_top = S(n_e, 2) - n_charm + 1 = S(13,2) - 20 + 1 = 91 - 20 + 1 = 72
# Primary derivation: n_top connects to the electron mode index via
# S(n_e,2) = C(14,2) = 91. Also: n_top = N_c * n_s * N_f = 3*4*6 = 72
# (the product of Euler characteristics of the three CP sectors).
n_top = S(n_e, 2) - n_charm + 1    # = 91 - 20 + 1 = 72

# --- Boson mode indices (Vandermonde rule) ------------------------------------
# The Vandermonde coupling rule: sectors d and d' couple when d+d' is itself
# a sector dimension, and the combined mode index is g(a, b) = a + b - 1.
# Each boson mode index is the Vandermonde combination of a fermion sector
# dimension and an occupied fermion mode index. (Part 3 section 11)

# n_W = g(d=5, n_top) = n_top + 5 - 1 = 76
# W boson: the nu-sector (d=5) coupled to the top quark mode.
# Cross-check: n_W = S(n_e, 2) - n_nu2 = C(14,2) - 15 = 91 - 15 = 76.
n_W = n_top + 5 - 1    # = 76

# n_Z = g(d=6, n_W) = n_W + 6 - 1 = 81
# Z boson: the lepton sector (d=6) coupled to the W mode.
# n_Z - n_W = 5 = q (the d=4 eigenstate increment at the up threshold);
# this is the same q that enters g22 (Theorem S3, Part 8 section 60b).
n_Z = n_W + 6 - 1      # = 81

# n_H = g(n_nu2, n_Z) = n_nu2 + n_Z - 1 = 95
# Higgs: the second neutrino mode coupled to the Z mode.
# Cross-check: n_H = n_up + n_charm + n_top = 3 + 20 + 72 = 95
# (the sum of all up-type quark mode indices -- the Higgs mode index encodes all
# three up-type sector modes simultaneously). (Part 3 section 11)
n_H = n_Z + n_nu2 - 1  # = 95


# =============================================================================
# STEP 2 -- COUPLING CONSTANTS FROM SEEDS
# =============================================================================
# The inter-sector coupling matrix G has rank 1: G_{dd'} = v_d x v_{d'} where
# v_d = sqrt(g_{dd}). All cross-couplings follow from the six self-couplings.
# g33 and g44 come entirely from the seeds {n_s, n_up}. (Part 2 section 8, Part 3 section 15)

# g33 = n_s^2 * sqrt(n_s + n_up) / 2 = 16 * sqrt(7) / 2 = 8*sqrt(7) ~= 21.166
# Derivation: the vacuum stability fixed-point equation for the d=3 sector
# kernel requires this exact value. The factor n_s^2 is k0 = 16 (the resonance
# site where the comb-resonance coupling concentrates), and sqrt(n_s+n_up)/2
# = sqrt(7)/2 is the universal Jacobi coefficient. (Part 2 section 8)
g33 = (n_strange**2) * math.sqrt(n_strange + n_up) / 2.0

# g44 = n_s * n_up / sqrt(n_s + n_up) = 12 / sqrt(7) ~= 4.536
# The d=4 self-coupling from seeds. Note: g33 * g44 = n_s^3 * n_up / 2 = 96
# exactly (8*sqrt(7) * 12/sqrt(7) = 8*12 = 96). This product 96 appears
# throughout: (4*sqrt(6))^2 = 96 = g_{3,4}^2 (cross-coupling between d=3 and
# d=4), and g55 * g22 = 96 (from Hopf fiber universality). (Part 2 sections 8-9)
g44 = (n_strange * n_up) / math.sqrt(n_strange + n_up)

# g66 = 1/n_s = 1/4
# The d=6 (charged lepton) self-coupling is set directly by the seed.
# g_{66} = 1/n_s = 1/4 is a seed ratio, not a kernel fixed-point coupling.
# This is why Hopf universality does not extend to generate a d=7 sector:
# there is no kernel fixed-point equation linking d=7 back to d=6.
# g_{10,10} = g_{66} = 1/n_s for the same reason (both CP sectors share
# the seed coupling). (Part 1 section 3a, Part 2 section 8)
g66 = 0.25


# =============================================================================
# STEP 3 -- SECTOR SCALES
# =============================================================================
# All sector scales are derived algebraically from m_e (the unit reference)
# and the seed-derived coupling constants. m_e sets the MeV scale; the
# dimensionless mass ratios are fixed entirely by each sector's manifold geometry.
# (Part 1 section 5, Part 2 sections 9c and 10)

m_e = 0.51099895    # MeV -- unit reference: converts dimensionless mass ratios to MeV

# m_scale_6 = m_e / S(n_e, 6) = m_e / S(13, 6) = m_e / 18564
# The electron (n=13, d=6) fixes the d=6 sector scale. Since m_e is known in MeV,
# m_scale_6 = m_e / S(13,6) converts the unit reference into the sector mass unit.
# Numerically: m_scale_6 ~= 2.7526 x 10^-5 MeV = 27.53 eV. (Part 2 section 10)
m_scale6 = m_e / S(n_e, 6)

# m_scale_3 = m_e * sqrt(g33 / g66)
# Coupling self-consistency: the kernel vacuum fixed-point equation requires
# m_scale_3^2 / m_e^2 = g33 / g66 (l=0 scalar part of the cross-sector kernel).
# m_scale_3 ~= 4.702 MeV. (Part 2 section 10)
m_scale3 = m_e * math.sqrt(g33 / g66)

# m_scale_4 = m_scale_3 * sqrt(g44 / g33) / S(n_up, 4)
# The d=4 scale is set by the fixed-point condition between d=3 and d=4,
# divided by S(n_up, 4) = S(3,4) = 15 to set the d=4 scale at the up quark mode
# (the lightest occupied d=4 mode at n=3). m_scale_4 ~= 0.1451 MeV. (Part 2 section 10)
m_scale4 = m_scale3 * math.sqrt(g44 / g33) / S(n_up, 4)

# m_scale_10 = m_scale_6
# g_{10,10} = g_{6,6} = 1/n_s = 1/4: the d=6 and d=10 sectors share the
# seed coupling. The tau mass exceeds the muon mass entirely because
# S(23,10) >> S(35,6) -- the sector scales are identical. (Part 2 section 10)
m_scale10 = m_scale6

# g22 = (M_{n_s-1}^{S^3} - n_up)^2 * q / 2     [Theorem S3, Part 8 section 60b]
#
# The positive Dirac eigenvalue at level l = n_s-1 = 3 on the unit 3-sphere S^3

#
# p = M_3^{S^3} - n_up  =  S(n_s,3) - n_up  =  20 - 3  =  17
#   The 20 eigenstates at Dirac level 3, less the n_up = 3 states already
#   accounted for by the up-quark sector boundary (Theorem S2).
#   [p replaces alpha to avoid collision with the fine structure constant]

# q  = S(n_up,4) - S(n_up,3)  =  15 - 10  =  5  =  S(n_up-1, 4)
#   The hockey-stick increment: d=4 eigenstate count at the up-quark threshold.
#   [q replaces beta to avoid collision with the QCD beta-function]
#
# The two-body kernel (xi.xi')^2 contributes p^2 (two d=3 legs, each
# with p available Dirac eigenstates) and q once (single d=4 insertion).
# The factor 1/2 is the Bose symmetry of the symmetric kernel.
#
# g22 = p^2 * q / 2  =  17^2 * 5 / 2  =  722.5   (exact from seeds)
# (Part 2 section 10, Theorem S3 Part 8 section 60b)
g22_p     = S(n_strange, 3) - n_up          # = 17

g22       = g22_p**2 * g22_q / 2.0          # = 722.5

# m_scale_2 = m_e * sqrt(g22 / g66)
# The d=2 sector scale: m_scale_2 = m_e × √(g₂₂/g₆₆). The W boson mass is

# STEP 4 -- CORRECTIONS
# =============================================================================

# --- Generation Tower Correction (GTC) ---------------------------------------
# The kernel coupling (xi_d . xi_{d'})^2 decomposes on S^{d-1} as:
#   (xi . xi')^2 = (1/d)[l=0 scalar] + (d-1)/d * C_2^{(d-2)/2}(cos theta)[l=2 tensor]
# For d=3 on S^2:  (xi . xi')^2 = (1/3)[l=0] + (2/3)*P_2(cos theta)[l=2]
# The l=0 part is constant -- it contributes to sector mass scales uniformly.
# The l=2 part is orientation-dependent -- it introduces a frequency shift
# per generation step. This shift grows with generation depth k, giving the
# multiplicative correction (1-eps)^k to d=4 quark masses. (Part 2 section 11)

# epsilon = 1 / (280 * sqrt(7)) ~= 0.001350
# Derived from: g_coeff / (k0 * n_mu). Each factor is independently forced:
#
#   g_coeff = 2/sqrt(7):  the l=2 kernel coupling coefficient at k0. Forced by
#     the double self-consistency condition -- both d=3 and d=4 give the same
#     eigenvalue 4/7 at the resonance:
#       d=3:  n_s*(n_s+1) / S(n_s,4) = 4*5/35 = 4/7
#       d=4:  n_up*(n_up+1) / S(n_up,5) = 3*4/21 = 4/7
#     g_coeff = sqrt(4/7) = 2/sqrt(7). This coincidence forces n_up = n_s-1 = 3.

#   k0 = n_s^2 = 16  (vacuum stability resonance site, from seed alone)
#
#   n_mu = S(n_s, 4) = 35  (the d=4 fixed-point mode; sets the frequency scale)

# The d=6 and d=10 sectors share the coupling g_{6,6} = g_{6,10} = g_{10,10}
# = 1/n_s = 1/4 (from the seed, not from hypercharge). The leading d=6->d=10
# kernel perturbation at the tau level has amplitude:
#
#   eps_{6->10} = 1 / (n_s^3 * S(n_s,4)) = 1/(64 * 35) = 1/2240
#
#   The n_s^3 = k0 * n_s factor is the seed-resonance volume; S(n_s,4) = n_mu
#   is the frequency normalization. Both are determined by n_s = 4 alone.
#
# This perturbation feeds back through g_{10,10} = 1/n_s, giving a geometric
# series summed as:
#
#   delta_m / m_tau = eps_{6->10} / (1 - g_{10,10})
#                   = (1/2240) / (1 - 1/4)

# The resummation factor n_s/(n_s-1) = 4/3 is forced by n_up = n_s-1.
#
# Result: m_tau = m_tau_bare * (1 + 1/1680) = 1776.84 MeV.

# The resonance spectrum in each sector d is {S(n,d) : n ≥ 1}.  Two purely

# IDWT sectors — they are consequences of m(n,d) = m_scale_d × S(n,d).
#
# IDENTITY 1: SPECTRAL SUM RULE      ζ_d(1) ≡ Σ_{n=1}^∞  1/S(n,d)  =  d/(d-1)
# Physical meaning: the reciprocal sum over the full resonance tower of a
# sector is a fixed rational number set by dimensionality alone.
# Proof (telescoping):
#   1/C(n+d-1,d) = [d/(d-1)] × [1/C(n+d-2,d-1) − 1/C(n+d-1,d-1)]
#   Summing: ζ_d(1) = [d/(d-1)] × [1 − 1/S(N,d-1)] → d/(d-1) as N→∞.
#
# IDENTITY 2: MODE SPACING (Pascal)   S(n+1,d) − S(n,d)  =  S(n+1,d-1)
# The gap between consecutive resonances in sector d equals the (n+1)-th

# The Gegenbauer coupling coefficient for sector d at the resonance site
# k_0 = n_s² = 16 is:
#
#   b_{k_0}(d)  =  sqrt( k_0 * (k_0 + d − 1) ) / ( 2*k_0 + d − 2 )
#
# The criticality condition b = 1/2 separates extended from localised modes:
#   b > 1/2 : supercritical — extended states, stable L²-modes exist.
#   b = 1/2 : critical — Gegenbauer critical point; modes at localisability boundary.
#   b < 1/2 : subcritical — localised states, no stable L²-normalizable modes.
#
# At d = 10 with k_0 = 16:
#   b_{16}(10) = sqrt(16 * 25) / (32 + 8) = sqrt(400) / 40 = 20/40 = 1/2.
#
# The equivalence 4*k_0 = (d − 2)² uniquely determines d = 10:
#   4 × 16 = 64 = (d − 2)²  =>  d − 2 = 8  =>  d = 10.
# All d < 10 have b > 1/2 (above the Jacobi coupling threshold); d ≥ 11 have
# b < 1/2 (below threshold), with no stable sector-bound resonances; sector
# chain terminates at d = 10.
# At the Gegenbauer critical point the naive perturbation series does not

# EULER CHARACTERISTIC OF CP^n:
#
#   χ(CP^n)  =  n + 1

# all odd Betti numbers vanish. The Euler characteristic is therefore
# χ = Σ (−1)^k b_k = (n+1) non-zero terms, each equal to 1, summing to n+1.

#
# Both equal N_c(N_c+1)³/2 = 3 × 64 / 2 = 96 (T15c).
#
# d=3 ↔ d=4 product: g_{33} = 8√7 and g_{44} = 12/√7 come from independent

# d=2 ↔ d=5 product: g_{55} is defined as 96/g_{22} by Hopf universality (STEP 5).
#   The Hopf fibration S¹ → S⁵ → CP² mediates d=2 (photon) to d=5 (neutrino)

# STEP 29 -- T0.5: TWO-STAGE OBSERVABILITY FILTER
# =============================================================================
# Theorem T0.5 (Part 9 §T0.5, Part 7): a mode (n,d) is a physical particle
# if and only if it passes both filters.
#
# ── STAGE 1: Dimensional Visibility  Ω_log(n,d) = ln(S(n,d)/S(n,2)) ≤ ln 2 ──
#
#   S(n,2) counts modes in the d=2 gauge sector (the observable reference).
#   S(n,d) counts modes in sector d. The ratio S(n,d)/S(n,2) grows rapidly
#   with sector index d: modes in high-d sectors have most of their vibrational
#   activity spread across extra dimensions. Ω_log = ln of this ratio quantifies
#   the dimensional depth. The threshold ln 2 ≈ 0.693 is the spectral half-power
#   point of the visibility kernel: above it, more than half the mode's activity
#   is in extra dimensions.
#
#   Two exempt classes (Stage 1 does not apply):
#   (a) d=2 gauge bosons: Ω_log ≡ 0 by definition (S(n,2)/S(n,2) = 1).
#   (b) d=4 up-type quarks: SU(3)_c gauge invariance forbids the operator that
#       would shift quark activity into extra dimensions, forcing the visible
#       amplitude A_rel = 1 regardless of Ω_log. Without this exemption, the
#       up quark (Ω_log = 0.916 > ln 2) would fail Stage 1.
#   d=3 down-type quarks are NOT exempt — their occupied modes happen to have
#   Ω_log ≤ ln 2 naturally: down quark Ω_log = 0, strange quark Ω_log = ln 2.
#
#   Important: Stage 1 and Stage 2 are logically independent. Leptons and
#   neutrinos all have Ω_log >> ln 2, but they are physically occupied because
#   they are co-fixed-points (Stage 2). Stage 1 measures dimensional suppression
#   (how extra-dimensional the mode is); Stage 2 measures resonance stability
#   (whether the mode is a fixed-point of the algebraic comb filtration). Large
#   Ω_log confirms extra-dimensional activity but does not preclude occupancy.
#   (Part 7 §1.1–1.2, Part 9 T0.5)
#
# ── STAGE 2: Co-fixed-point condition  (n, d) ∈ Σ_pairs ─────────────────────
#
#   n must be a co-fixed-point of the sector comb filtration generated from
#   seeds {n_s=4, n_d=1} by the hockey-stick recursion
#     S(n+1, d) = S(n, d) + S(n, d−1)
#   and the Vandermonde coupling rule (STEP 1). The physical (n,d) pairs Σ_pairs
#   are exactly the 15 particles derived in STEP 1. Their membership is not a
#   postulate: it follows entirely from the two seed values {4, 1} and the two
#   recursion rules. Modes outside Σ_pairs may satisfy Stage 1 but are not
#   stable resonances of M_∞. For example, d=3 modes at n=2 and n=3 both pass
#   Stage 1 (Ω_log < ln 2) but fail Stage 2; they are short-lived colour-triplet
#   excitations, not stable particles. (Part 7 §1.3, Part 2 §2–4)

    Raw IDWT prediction: m = m_scale(d) * S(n, d), no corrections applied.

    Special cases:
    - photon: S(0, 2) = C(1,2) = 0, giving m = 0 exactly. The photon is the
      n=0 (ground state fiber) mode of the d=2 gauge sector. Zero simplex
      value is zero mass. (Part 3 section 14)

    - bottom: not a standard simplex mode. The b quark arises from a triple
      resonance at the d=3 resonance site k0 = n_s^2 = 16. Three independent
      conditions coincide at k0:
          k0 = n_s^2 = 16
          k0 = n_e + n_up = 13 + 3 = 16
          k0 = S(n_s,3) - S(2,3) = 20 - 4 = 16
      The triple coincidence forces equal spectral weight at modes n=16 and
      n=17. This is derived from the Jacobi coupling between adjacent modes:
        K_{16,17} proportional to sqrt(b_16 * b_17)
        where b_n = sqrt(n*(n+d-1)) / (2n+d-2)  for d=3.
      At the triple-resonance site, the l=0 kernel drive is equal for both
      modes. The equal-weight fixed-point condition |A_16|=|A_17| gives the
      mass as the solution to E^2 = E_16 * E_17, i.e. the geometric mean:
          m_b = sqrt(S(16,3) * S(17,3)) * m_scale_3
      S(16,3) = C(18,3) = 816, S(17,3) = C(19,3) = 969.
      Result: ~4181 MeV vs PDG 4180 MeV (+0.02%). (Part 2 section 12, Part 7)
      The geometric mean is forced by symmetry at the resonance; it is not
      chosen to fit the data. No other combination is consistent with equal
      spectral weight and the quadratic kernel fixed-point equation.
