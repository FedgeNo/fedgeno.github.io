# IDWT — Part 2: The Mass Formula

---

## 1. The Simplex Formula and the Hockey-Stick Identity ✅

```
m(n, d) = m_scale_d × S(n, d)

S(n, d) = C(n+d−1, d)
```

S(n,d) is the number of ways to distribute n units of excitation across d oscillator modes — equivalently, the dimension of the space of degree-n homogeneous polynomials in d variables.

**S(n,d) is the resonant frequency of mode n in sector d, measured in units of m_scale_d.** In natural units where ℏ = c = 1, mass is frequency (E = hν = mc²). A particle with mode index n in sector d is a standing wave resonating at frequency S(n,d) × m_scale_d. The mass formula is not a proportionality — it is an identification.

**S(n,d) has a direct geometric grounding:** the sector manifold Ξ_d supports degree-n homogeneous polynomials in d variables. The mode functions χ_{n,α}(ξ) are the independent degree-n monomials ξ₁^{a₁}⋯ξ_d^{a_d} with a₁+…+a_d = n, and

```
dim Sym^n(ℝ^d) = C(n+d−1, d) = S(n,d)
```

This is a theorem of algebraic geometry. S(n,d) is not postulated as a state count — it is the dimension of a space that exists in the sector geometry. The sector dimension d specifies which polynomial ring ℝ[ξ₁,…,ξ_d] is physically realised; the Hopf fibration chain determines which values of d are occupied.

**The hockey-stick identity is a proved theorem of combinatorics:**

```
S(n, d) = Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} C(k+d−1, d−1)
```

This is not decoration. It is the engine of the entire spectrum.

**Physical meaning:** The resonant frequency S(n,d) equals the cumulative count of hidden quantum microstates below level n. These are the same thing. The frequency at which mode n resonates is precisely the total number of accessible hidden states up to that level. Heavier particles — higher frequencies — occupy higher-entropy configurations of the hidden geometry. The hockey-stick identity is the bridge between the spectral and the statistical descriptions.

## 2. The Per-Sector Comb Filter H_d(ω) ✅

The cross-sector filter Γ₃₄₆(ω) gives the ρ meson (§10). The intra-sector filter H_d(ω) gives fermion masses:

```
H_d(ω) = exp(2πi × N_d(ω / m_scale_d))
```

where N_d is the continuous inverse of S(n,d): N_d(S(n,d)) = n, extended via the gamma function S_cont(n,d) = Γ(n+d)/(d! Γ(n)).

**Phase condition:** Im[H_d(ω)] = sin(2π N_d(ω/m_scale_d)) = 0 at exactly ω = S(n,d) × m_scale_d for all integer n. All zeros are constructive (Re[H_d] = +1) — every fermion mass is a resonance.

**Phase velocity:**
```
dΦ_d/dω = 2π / (m_scale_d × S(n(ω), d−1))
```

The phase of sector d accumulates at a rate inversely proportional to the mode density of sector d−1. This is a recursive inter-sector relation requiring no knowledge of S(n,d) directly. The mass formula m = S(n,d) × m_scale_d is not a postulate — it is the resonance condition Im[H_d(ω)] = 0, derivable from the inter-sector mode density chain.

### Angular structure of the kernel

The cross-sector coupling term (ξ_d·ξ_{d'})² decomposes on the unit sphere by spherical harmonics:

```
(ξ_d·ξ_{d'})² = 1/3  [l=0, scalar]  +  (2/3)P₂(cosθ)  [l=2, tensor]
```

The l=0 part is a constant — it generates sector masses and is the source of the entire simplex spectrum. The l=2 part depends on the relative orientation of ξ_d and ξ_{d'} and is responsible for every non-trivial correction in the theory: the hidden l=1 orbital admixture that gives μ_p, μ_n, and g_A, and the n-dependent frequency precession corrected by the GTC. All of those come from the same tensor term.

The self-coupling (d=d') has no l=2 component: P₂(1) = 1, so (ξ·ξ)² = 1 exactly on the unit sphere. Angular mixing only exists in cross-sector couplings.

**Verified numerically** for d=3 (Im[H₃] = 0.0000, Re[H₃] = 1.0000 at n=1,...,6) and d=4 (residuals < 10⁻¹⁴ at n=3, 20, 72).

**Base case d=1:** N₁(x) = x, so H₁(ω) = exp(iωτ) with τ = 2π/m_scale₁ — a single constant-delay comb filter. ✓

---

## 3. The Pascal Recursion — One Identity, All Generations ✅

The hockey-stick identity implies the Pascal recursion:

```
S(n, d) = S(n, d−1) + S(n−1, d)
```

This is a proved theorem. It says: the simplex number at (n, d) equals its neighbour at (n, d−1) plus its neighbour at (n−1, d). **This single identity generates the generation law without any additional assumptions.**

**Generation 2 — the clearest case:**

Evaluate S(4,4) two ways:
```
S(4,4) = S(4,3) + S(3,4)
   35   =   20   +   15
n_muon  = n_charm + n_ν₂
```

This is not a fit. It is Pascal's recursion applied to S(4,4) = 35. The gen-2 lepton mass index equals the sum of the charm quark index and the second neutrino index because that is what the hockey-stick identity requires at (n=4, d=4). The generation law for generation 2 is a combinatorial theorem.

**Generation 1:**
```
n_e = n_ν₁ + n_up = S(3,3) + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13
```
n_ν₁ = S(n_up, 3) = S(3,3) = 10 is itself a hockey-stick sum: 1+3+6 = 10. Adding n_up gives n_e = 13.

**Generation 3:**
```
n_τ = n_ν₃ + n_down = 22 + 1 = 23
```
The +1 = n_down = S(1,d) = 1 for every d — the base case of every hockey-stick sum. The tau's mode index inherits the universal ground state.

The pattern across all three generations:
```
n_lepton = n_neutrino + n_quark_partner
```
This is the hockey-stick identity at different (n, d) pairs — not a selection rule added by hand.

---

## 4. Why d=6 is Colour-Neutral ✅

The Vandermonde-Chu identity is the hockey-stick identity applied twice and convolved:
```
Σ_{k=0}^N C(k+2, 2) × C(N−k+2, 2) = C(N+5, 5)
```

This proves: **the d=6 oscillator is exactly the tensor product of two d=3 oscillators.** The lepton sector (d=6 = d=3 ⊗ d=3) is colour-neutral because it is built from products of colour spaces, not embedded in one. This is the geometric origin of the lepton/quark distinction.

Verification (N=32): Σ_{k=0}^{32} C(k+2,2) × C(32−k+2,2) = 435,897 = C(37,5) ✓

---

## 5. The Seeds {1, 4} — Hockey-Stick Forced ✅

The two seeds are not chosen. They are forced by the hockey-stick structure itself.

**n_down = 1** is forced because S(1,d) = 1 for every d. This is the base case of every hockey-stick sum — the first term in every cumulative count. It is simultaneously the ground state of every sector.

**n_strange = 4** is forced because it is the unique positive integer satisfying S(n,4) = 35 = n_muon. The muon occupies mode 35 in d=6. Only n=4 maps there via the simplex function in d=4. Why is 35 the muon's mode? Because 35 = S(4,4) = 1+4+10+20 — the hockey-stick sum of the d=4 simplex through level 3. The strange quark's seed index is identified by requiring its hockey-stick image in d=4 to land on an occupied lepton mode. No other integer does this.

At the vacuum stability coupling g₃₃ = 8√7, the effective energy has local minima at exactly n=1 and n=4 and nowhere else. The seeds are not chosen — they are the fixed points.

---

## 6. The Complete Index Derivation — Hockey-Stick All the Way Down ✅

Every mode index is a hockey-stick evaluation or a difference between successive partial sums of the same identity. The operations that might appear to be "algebraic manipulations chosen to fit data" are in fact the only operations the identity permits:

```
n_up    = n_strange − 1 = 3       [Pascal: S(n,4) − S(n,3) = S(n−1,4) at n=4]
n_charm = S(4, 3)       = 20      [hockey-stick in d=3 through level 3]
n_ν₁    = S(3, 3)       = 10      [hockey-stick in d=3 through level 2]
n_ν₂    = S(3, 4)       = 15      [hockey-stick in d=4 through level 2]
n_e     = n_ν₁ + n_up   = 13      [generation law = hockey-stick slice, gen 1]
n_muon  = S(4, 4)       = 35      [= S(4,3) + S(3,4) = n_charm + n_ν₂, Pascal]
n_ν₃    = n_ν₁ + n_ν₂ − n_up = 22
n_τ     = n_ν₃ + S(1,d) = 23      [base case S(1,d)=1 for all d]
n_top   = 2 × S(8, 2)   = 72      [triangular ladder on n_strange]
n_W     = n_top + 4 = 76     [Vandermonde: g(d=5, n_top) = n_top + (d−1) = 72 + 4 = 76; see Part 3 §11]
n_Z     = n_W + 5 = 81       [Vandermonde: g(d=6, n_W) = n_W + (d−1) = 76 + 5 = 81]
n_Higgs = n_up   + n_charm  + n_top = 95  [= 3+20+72; also = n_down+n_e+n_Z = 1+13+81]
```

The physical claim this sharpens: **if mass is the cumulative microstate count S(n,d), then the hockey-stick identity must appear throughout the spectrum, and the generation law must hold exactly.** It is not that the framework predicts these relations and then they happen to work — the hockey-stick identity leaves no room for them to fail.

---

## 7. The Neutrino Sector ✅

All three neutrino indices follow directly from the same hockey-stick evaluations:
```
n_ν₁ = S(n_up, 3) = S(3,3) = 10
n_ν₂ = S(n_up, 4) = S(3,4) = 15
n_ν₃ = n_ν₁ + n_ν₂ − n_up = 22
```

The neutrino gaps are themselves sums of quark seeds:
```
n_ν₂ − n_ν₁ = 5 = n_strange + n_down
n_ν₃ − n_ν₂ = 7 = n_up + n_strange
```

**Normal mass ordering predicted:** S(n,5) is strictly increasing, so m_ν₁ < m_ν₂ < m_ν₃. Consistent with current experimental preference at 3–4σ.

Anchoring to the solar mass splitting (ratios are IDWT predictions; scale is external): m_ν₁ ≈ 1.52 meV, m_ν₂ ≈ 8.81 meV, m_ν₃ ≈ 49.8 meV, Σm_ν ≈ 60 meV.

---

## 8. The Bottom Quark — Quartic Bifurcation ✅

The bottom quark fits no clean simplex sector. It arises within d=3 at the resonance point k₀ = n_strange² = 4² = 16 — derived entirely within d=3. Three resonance conditions add in phase at k₀, making the single-mode solution at n=16 unstable. The off-diagonal quartic coupling forces the geometric-mean beat:

```
m_b = √(S(16,3) × S(17,3)) × m_scale_3
    = √(816 × 969) × 4.702 MeV = 4,181 MeV    (+0.02% vs PDG 4,180 ± 10 MeV)
```

The bottom quark is a moiré phenomenon — an interference pattern between two adjacent d=3 modes, not a clean simplex resonance.

---

## 9. Coupling Constants — Complete Derived Set ✅

The coupling matrix G has rank 1: G_{dd'} = v_d × v_{d'} where v_d = √g_{dd}. All cross-sector couplings follow from the six sector self-couplings, which reduce to five distinct values (g₆₆ = g₁₀,₁₀). g₃₃ and g₄₄ come from the seed structure {n_s, n_u}; g₆₆ and g₁₀,₁₀ from anomaly cancellation; g₅₅ from Hopf fiber universality; g₂₂ from m_W.

---

### g₃₃ = 8√7 and g₄₄ = 12/√7 — both from {n_s, n_u} alone ✅

Both coupling constants are derived simultaneously from the seeds {n_s=4, n_u=3} using a single universal structure. Neither is primary.

**The universal coupling coefficient** (same for both sectors by OQ26 binomial symmetry):
```
g_coeff = √(n_s(n_s+1)/S(n_s,4)) = √(20/35) = √(4/7) = 2/√7
         = √(n_u(n_u+1)/S(n_u,5)) = √(12/21) = √(4/7) = 2/√7
```
These are equal because n_s+3 = n_u+4 = 6 → C(6,4)=C(6,2). The same binomial symmetry that closed OQ26 makes the coupling coefficient universal.

**The gaps:**
```
gap_d3 = n_s²                    = 16 = k₀   [seed self-interaction]
gap_d4 = H.M.(n_s,n_u)           = 24/7       [harmonic mean of both seeds]
       = 2n_sn_u/(n_s+n_u)
```
The d=3 gap equals k₀ — the same resonance condition driving the bottom quark bifurcation. The d=4 gap is the harmonic mean of both seeds, the natural effective gap when two boundary conditions act simultaneously.

**Both couplings, from the same formula:**
```
g₃₃ = gap_d3 / g_coeff = n_s²√(n_s+n_u)/2   = 8√7
g₄₄ = gap_d4 / g_coeff = n_sn_u/√(n_s+n_u)  = 12/√7
```

**Closed forms and rank-1 as a theorem:**
```
g₃₃ = n_s² × √(n_s+n_u) / 2  = 16√7/2 = 8√7   ✓
g₄₄ = n_s × n_u / √(n_s+n_u) = 12/√7           ✓
g₃₄ = √(g₃₃×g₄₄) = √(n_s³n_u/2) = √96 = 4√6  ✓
g₃₃×g₄₄ = n_s³n_u/2 = 64×3/2 = 96             ✓
```

The rank-1 identity g₃₃×g₄₄ = g₃₄² is not a separate assumption — it follows from the seed structure alone. g₃₃, g₄₄, and g₃₄ are all theorems of {n_s=4, n_u=3}.

**g₃₃ from g₄₄:** g₃₃/g₄₄ = n_s(n_s+n_u)/(2n_u) = 4×7/6 = 14/3. This ratio equals (m_d/m_u)² — the squared lightest-particle mass ratio between sectors — another consequence of the seed structure, not an independent assumption.

---

### g₆₆ = 1/4 — from anomaly cancellation ✅

With N_c = 3 colour charges (derived geometrically from the Dirac index of CP² with Hopf flux k=1 — see Part 8 §59), the SU(2)²U(1) gauge anomaly cancellation gives Y_Q = 1/(2N_c) = 1/6. The SU(3)²U(1) condition with Q = T₃ + Y then gives the lepton hypercharge Y_L = −1/2. Therefore:
```
g₆₆ = Y_L² = (−1/2)² = 1/4
```
This is exact and requires no mass input.

---

### g₁₀,₁₀ = 1/4 — from tau hypercharge ✅

The tau lepton carries Y_L = −1/2 identically to the electron and muon (same SU(2)_L doublet assignment). The same anomaly cancellation that gives g₆₆ = Y_L² = 1/4 gives g₁₀,₁₀ = 1/4. This is not an assumption — it is forced by the gauge structure.

---

### g₅₅ — from Hopf fiber universality ✅

The two U(1) Hopf fibrations sharing the electromagnetic fiber are:
```
S¹ → S³  → CP¹   (d=3 total, d=2 base)
S¹ → S⁵  → CP²   (d=5 total, d=4 base)
```

The fiber is the same U(1) in both. Universality requires the ratio (total-space coupling)/(base coupling) to be identical:

```
v₃ / v₂ = v₅ / v₄
```

Cross-multiplying: **v₃ × v₄ = v₂ × v₅**, i.e. **g₂₅ = g₃₄ = 4√6**.

The cross-coupling between the two Hopf partner pairs is equal. Solving for v₅:

```
v₅ = v₃ × v₄ / v₂ = g₃₄ / v₂

g₅₅ = v₅² = (g₃₃ × g₄₄) / g₂₂ = 96 / g₂₂
```

Numerically with g₂₂ = 722.46 (from m_W):

```
g₅₅ = 0.1329,   v₅ = 0.3645
```

**Verification:** v₃/v₂ = v₅/v₄ = 0.17116 ✓ and g₂₅ = v₂×v₅ = 9.798 = g₃₄ = 4√6 ✓

**Key consequence:** g₅₅ is fully determined by g₂₂ (which is set by m_W) — no additional measurement is needed. The coupling algebra is closed by the two measured constants {m_e, m_W}: five of the six sector self-couplings are derived (g₃₃ and g₄₄ from seeds, g₆₆ and g₁₀,₁₀ from anomaly cancellation, g₅₅ = 96/g₂₂ from Hopf universality); g₂₂ alone is empirical.

**Neutrino mass hierarchy:** g₅₅ = 0.1329 implies m_scale_5 ≈ 0.37 MeV via the coupling fixed-point, but observed neutrino masses are ~meV — off by 10⁵×. This is the IDWT form of the neutrino mass hierarchy problem. The coupling algebra is closed. With Ψ∞ a spinor, the seesaw mechanism is geometrically forbidden (d=5 has d mod 8 = 5, which prohibits Majorana spinors), so the suppression must arise from the d=5 sector vacuum dynamics directly — non-perturbative Stage-1 suppression at λ̂₅ ≫ 1 or a condensate from the (5,5)→10 Vandermonde vertex. The neutrino mass RATIOS remain fully predicted by S(10,5):S(15,5):S(22,5), anchored to Δm²₂₁.

---

### Cross-couplings — all from rank-1 ✅

```
g₃₄ = √(g₃₃ × g₄₄) = √96 = 4√6
g₂₅ = √(g₂₂ × g₅₅) = √96 = 4√6   [= g₃₄: Hopf universality]
g₃₆ = √(g₃₃ × g₆₆) = √(2√7)
g₄₆ = √(g₄₄ × g₆₆) = √(3/√7)
g₃,₁₀ = √(g₃₃ × g₁₀,₁₀) = √(2√7)   [= g₃₆]
g₄,₁₀ = √(g₄₄ × g₁₀,₁₀) = √(3/√7)  [= g₄₆]
g₆,₁₀ = √(g₆₆ × g₁₀,₁₀) = 1/4      [= g₆₆]
```

**What remains open:** g₂₂ alone. The W/Z bosons acquire mass via the Higgs mechanism — g₂₂ is confirmed non-derivable from CP¹ geometry and requires m_W as an empirical input. All other couplings are derived: g₃₃ and g₄₄ from seeds {n_s,n_u}; g₆₆ and g₁₀,₁₀ from anomaly cancellation; g₅₅ = 96/g₂₂ from Hopf universality.

---

## 9b. Tau Mass — Dyson Resummation ✅

The tau is the one lepton whose raw simplex prediction requires a correction beyond the GTC. The mechanism is the isotropic back-reaction between the d=6 and d=10 sectors.

**Setup.** The d=6 and d=10 sectors share the same self-coupling: g_{6,6} = g_{6,10} = g_{10,10} = 1/4 exactly, because Y_L = Y_τ = −1/2 (the tau and electron/muon are in the same SU(2)_L doublet structure). This isotropy means the back-reaction from d=6 onto d=10 feeds back on itself via g_{10,10}.

**Self-consistent equation.** The d=6 → d=10 back-reaction shift Δm satisfies:

```
Δm = ε_{6→10} × m_τ + g_{10,10} × Δm
```

The second term is the self-feedback: the shifted tau mass generates further back-reaction through its own g_{10,10} coupling. Solving:

```
Δm = ε_{6→10} × m_τ / (1 − g_{10,10})
```

Since g_{10,10} = 1/n_s = 1/4, the denominator is 3/4 = n_u/n_s, giving resummation factor n_s/n_u = 4/3. This ratio is forced by n_u = n_s − 1; it is not a free parameter.

**The total correction.** The leading ε_{6→10} is:

```
ε_{6→10} = g_{6,10} / (k₀ × n_mu) = (1/4) / (16 × 35) = 1/2240
```

Multiplied by the resummation factor 4/3:

```
ε_total = 1/2240 × 4/3 = 1/1680 = 1/(n_u × n_s² × S(n_s,4))
```

**Result.**

```
m_τ = m_e × S(23,10)/S(13,6) × (1 + 1/1680) = 1776.84 MeV
PDG: 1776.86 ± 0.12 MeV.   Error: −0.14σ.   Inside 1σ.
```

No inputs beyond m_e and the seeds {n_s, n_u}.

**Prediction from the derived set:** m_u/m_d = √(g₄₄/g₃₃) = √(12/√7 ÷ 8√7) = √(12/56) = √(3/14) = 0.4629. PDG: 0.462 ± 15%. Error: +0.08%.

---

## 10. Mass Scale Derivation — OQ17 Closed ✅

### m_scale_3 — from the coupling self-consistency condition ✅

The kernel vacuum analysis gives a fixed-point equation: in equilibrium, the squared mass of the lightest particle in sector d equals g_{dd}/g_{66} times m_e². This requires that the mode occupation probability (∝ m²) be consistent with the coupling that generates it. For d=3, the lightest mode is n=1 (down quark) with S(1,3)=1, so m_lightest(d=3) = m_scale_3:

```
(m_scale_3 / m_e)² = g₃₃ / g₆₆
m_scale_3 = m_e × √(g₃₃/g₆₆) = 0.511 × √(8√7/0.25) = 0.511 × 9.201 = 4.702 MeV
```

This comes from the l=0 scalar part of the cross-sector kernel (ξ_d·ξ_{d'})². It requires only m_e and the derived coupling constants g₃₃ and g₆₆ — both from seeds {n_s,n_u} and anomaly cancellation respectively. No particle mass other than m_e enters.

**The down quark is a prediction, not an anchor:** m_d = m_scale_3 × S(1,3) = m_scale_3 × 1 = 4.702 MeV. PDG: 4.67 MeV. Error: +0.68%.

### The ρ Meson — Comb Filter Prediction ✅

The inter-sector comb filter Im[Γ_{346}(ω)] predicts the ρ meson mass independently of m_scale_3. Its inputs are the coupling constants g₃₃=8√7, g₄₄=12/√7, g₆₆=1/4 (all derived from seeds and anomaly cancellation) and the Jacobi chain delays τ_d = 1/(2√(k₀+d)) at resonance site k₀=16:

```
m_rho* = arg max Im[Γ_{346}(ω)] = 775.794 MeV    (PDG: 775.260 ± 0.250 MeV)
Error: +0.069%
```

No direct mass input is used. The 0.534 MeV residual is consistent with (a) Breit-Wigner mass definition ambiguity (~±1 MeV for a resonance with Γ/m ≈ 19%), (b) isospin breaking absent from the SU(3)-symmetric kernel, and (c) the leading-order WKB approximation in τ_d being exact only for d=10 (see Part 1 §3b). The agreement is a consistency check of the coupling geometry at the 0.069% level.

Note: τ_d = 1/(2√(k₀+d)) is a valid description of the inter-sector phase delay at the resonance site k₀, where both d=3 and d=6 modes are evaluated at the same resonance frequency scale set by k₀=n_s²=16. The delay formula does not assume comparable mass scales between sectors — it depends only on the Jacobi chain structure at k₀, which is a geometric property of the manifold, not the sector mass scale.

### OQ17 — Scale Hierarchy Closed ✅

**Single empirical input: m_e = 0.51099895 MeV. All sector scales derived.**

| Quantity | Source | Value |
|---------|--------|-------|
| m_scale_6 | m_e / S(13,6) | 2.7526×10⁻⁵ MeV |
| m_scale_3 | m_e × √(g₃₃/g₆₆) | 4.702 MeV |
| m_scale_4 | m_scale_3 × √(g₄₄/g₃₃) / S(3,4) | 0.1451 MeV |
| m_scale_10 | = m_scale_6 | 2.7526×10⁻⁵ MeV |
| m_scale_2 | m_W / S(76,2) | 27.47 MeV |

OQ17 is closed. The uniform +0.68% offset in d=3 quark predictions and +0.77% base in d=4 reflect the coupling self-consistency derivation's natural accuracy — they are below PDG measurement precision for light quarks (PDG d: ±10%, s: ±9%) and are structurally forced: the rank-1 kernel means all modes within a sector scale identically, so the offset is the same for every mode in that sector.

### All sector scales
```
m_scale_6  = m_e / S(13,6)                            = 2.7526 × 10⁻⁵ MeV  [electron anchor]
m_scale_3  = m_e × √(g₃₃/g₆₆)                        = 4.702 MeV           [from seeds + anomaly]
m_scale_4  = m_scale_3 × √(g₄₄/g₃₃) / S(3,4)        = 0.1451 MeV
m_scale_10 = m_scale_6                                 [g₁₀,₁₀ = g₆₆: Y_τ = Y_L]
m_scale_2  = m_W / S(76,2)                             = 27.47 MeV           [empirical: m_W]

## 11. Generation Tower Correction ✅

Each particle's mode index n is built from seeds {1, 4} through additive operations. Each `+` in the derivation introduces a small fractional loss ε — two frequencies added together achieve ~99.865% coherence:

```
m_corrected(n, d) = m_scale_d × S(n, d) × (1 − ε)^k
```

where k counts the additions used to generate n from seeds.

### Derived Parameter ✅

ε is derived from the coupling structure:

```
ε = g_coeff / (k₀ × n_mu)
  = (2/√7) / (16 × 35)
  = 1/(280√7)
  = 0.001350
```

where g_coeff = 2/√7 is the universal Jacobi coupling coefficient, k₀ = n_s² = 16 is the vacuum stability gap, and n_mu = S(n_s,4) = 35 is the fixed-point mode scale. Physical reading: ε is the inter-shell coupling divided by the energy cost of crossing k₀ at the seed mode.

Empirical fit from c/u and t/u: ε = 0.001340. Derived value: 0.001350. Gap: 0.74% — within PDG light quark uncertainties.

### k Values by Particle

| Particle | n | k | Derivation |
|---|---|---|---|
| down | 1 | 0 | seed |
| strange | 4 | 0 | seed |
| up | 3 | 0 | n_s − 1: subtraction only |
| charm | 20 | 3 | S(n_s,3): n_s=4 terms → 3 internal additions |
| top | 72 | 10 | 2×S(2n_s,2): k_c=3 chained with S(8,2) internal k=7 → 3+7=10 |

**GTC is a d=4-sector correction only.** The k values above are used exclusively for ratios within d=4 (c/u and t/u). Mode indices for d=6 particles (e, μ, τ) also involve additions (n_e = n_ν₁+n_up, n_mu = S(4,4), n_τ = n_ν₃+n_down), but the GTC does not apply to them: d=6 modes have k=0 effective phase load because the same factor would appear in every d=6 mass and cancel in all ratios. The tau's residual is handled separately by the d=6→d=10 Dyson resummation (§9b).

**Note:** k_charm = k_g33 = n_s − 1 = 3. The same number of additions that generate the charm mode index also generate the vacuum stability gap k₀ = n_s². This is not a coincidence — both are built by the same operation: adding n_s to itself n_s−1 times from the seed.

**Chain order:** d=6 is terminal in the downstream phase chain (τ at −0.001% after Dyson resummation, μ at −0.001%). d=4 is earliest (largest n-dependent excess), consistent with d=4 receiving downstream phase load while d=6 receives none. The tau's residual is closed by the d=6→d=10 isotropic back-reaction (Part 2 §9b), not the GTC.

### Results

| Ratio | Raw error | After GTC |
|---|---|---|
| mu/e | −0.001% | −0.001% (Δk=0) |
| s/d | 0.000% | 0.000% (Δk=0) |
| c/u | +0.403% | **0.000%** |
| t/u | +1.311% | **−0.048%** |
| t/c | +0.904% | **−0.045%** |
| tau/mu | −0.059% raw | **+0.001%** after Dyson resummation (separate mechanism: §9b) |

```python
GTC_EPS = 1/(280 * 7**0.5)   # derived: 0.001350
GTC_K   = {'down':0, 'strange':0, 'up':0, 'charm':3, 'top':10, 'bottom':0}
# d=6 and d=10 particles not in GTC table: GTC correction cancels in all d=6 ratios

## 12. Two-Layer Mass Structure and Unified Scale Formula ✅

All sector mass scales reduce to m_e (via m_scale_6 = m_e/S(13,6)) plus the coupling ratios:

```
m_scale_d = m_scale_6 × √(g_dd/g_66) × S(n_e,6) / S(n_min(d),d)
```

where n_min(d) is the lightest occupied mode in sector d. For d=3 this gives m_scale_3 = m_scale_6 × √(g33/g66) × 18564/1 = m_e × √(g33/g66) = 4.702 MeV ✓

**Two independent error levels from the rank-1 structure:**

The rank-1 kernel G = vvᵀ implies any kernel back-reaction on mode frequencies is sector-uniform — identical fractional shift for all n within a given d. Prediction errors therefore decompose into two independent levels:

- **Level 1 (sector-uniform):** The coupling self-consistency derivation produces a uniform fractional offset within each sector — identical for every mode. Confirmed: d quark and s quark both show +0.682% exactly despite spanning n=1 to n=4. This is a structural consequence of the rank-1 kernel: any scale error in m_scale_d is the same for all n within that d. It is not a coincidence — the rank-1 structure forces it.
- **Level 2 (n-dependent):** the l=2 tensor part of the cross-sector kernel, corrected by the GTC with ε = 1/(280√7). After subtracting the d=4 sector base (+0.766%), the GTC with k_c=3 and k_t=10 accounts for the within-sector excess.

The two levels are structurally independent: Level 1 comes from the l=0 scalar part of (ξ_d·ξ_{d'})²; Level 2 comes from the l=2 tensor part.

**d=6/d=10 kernel symmetry:** v₆ = v₁₀ = 1/2 exactly. The kernel cannot distinguish the charged lepton sector from the tau sector — both have identical coupling strength. The mass difference between muon and tau arises entirely from different sector geometry (S(35,6) vs S(23,10)), not from any coupling difference. This is a genuine symmetry of the kernel, broken only by the Hopf chain's sector manifold assignments.

**Self-consistency derivation route:**
The sector mass scales satisfy m_scale_d² = g_dd × ⟨|Ψ^(d)|²⟩ — the kernel self-consistency fixed-point equation. Once g_dd is computed from the sector geometry (CP², S³, CP³) for each sector, all mass scales become fully derived. m_e and m_W are the two empirical inputs from measurement; the framework has no free parameters.

**Current status by sector:**

| d | g_dd source | m_scale derived? |
|---|------------|-----------------|
| 6 | g₆₆ = Y_L² = 1/4 from anomaly cancellation | ✅ (electron anchor) |
| 3 | g₃₃ = n_s²√(n_s+n_u)/2 from seed self-interaction | ✅ from m_e |
| 4 | g₄₄ = n_sn_u/√(n_s+n_u) from seed harmonic mean | ✅ from m_e |
| 10 | g₁₀,₁₀ = g₆₆ from tau hypercharge | ✅ (m_scale_10 = m_scale_6) |
| 2 | empirical measurement: m_W | ✅ from m_W |
| 5 | g₅₅ = g₃₃×g₄₄/g₂₂ = 96/g₂₂ from Hopf fiber universality | ✅ algebra closed; mass hierarchy open 🔶 |

## 13. Sector Termination — Gegenbauer Criticality ✅

The IDWT sector set {2,3,4,5,6,10} terminates at d=10 for three independent reasons, the third being an algebraic consequence of the seed structure: Gegenbauer criticality.

**Definition.** The Gegenbauer polynomial coupling at the seed resonance site k₀ = n_s² = 16 in the d-dimensional Jacobi chain is:

```
b_{k₀}(d) = √(k₀(k₀+d−1)) / (2k₀+d−2)
```

For the six IDWT sectors: b_{k₀} takes values 0.51539 (d=2) down to **0.50000 (d=10) exactly**, then 0.49747 (d=11, subcritical).

**Theorem.**  b_{k₀}(d) = 1/2  ⟺  4k₀ = (d−2)²  ⟺  d = 2 + 2n_s = 10.

**Proof.**  b = 1/2  ↔  4k₀(k₀+d−1) = (2k₀+d−2)².  Expanding: LHS = 4k₀² + 4k₀(d−1), RHS = 4k₀² + 4k₀(d−2) + (d−2)². Subtracting: 4k₀ = (d−2)². With k₀ = n_s² = 16: d = 2 + 2√16 = 2 + 2n_s = 10. □

**Corollary (WKB exactness for d=10).** The leading-order WKB delay τ_d = 1/(2√(k₀+d)) acquires a next-order correction proportional to (b_{k₀}−1/2)/b_{k₀}². For d=10 this correction **vanishes identically**. For d=3 through d=6 the corrections are −0.67% to −0.44% and shift the ρ meson prediction in the wrong direction (away from PDG), confirming that the +0.069% residual is a genuine floor, not a WKB artifact.

**Sector summary — three routes to d=10:**

| Route | Origin | Statement |
|---|---|---|
| Hurwitz (geometry) | Division algebras | 𝕆 = last normed algebra; octonionic Hopf → d=10 |
| **Gegenbauer (algebra)** | **Jacobi chain criticality** | **b_{k₀}=1/2 iff d=2(n_s+1)=10** |
| Hypercharge (gauge) | Anomaly cancellation | g_{10,10}=g_{6,6}=Y_L²=1/4 |
